        <h1>How Long Does It Take to Import a Car from Japan to Australia?</h1>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Typical timeframes for the import process — and why we give you a clear expectation when you enquire.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; margin: 0 0 0.5rem;">Summary</h2>
          <p style="margin: 0;">The time to import a car from Japan to Australia typically includes: sourcing the vehicle (e.g. at auction), compliance and certification (e.g. RAWS), shipping to your chosen Australian port, and customs clearance. Total timeframes often fall in a range of several weeks to a few months depending on the vehicle, auction schedule, compliance workload and shipping. We outline expected timelines when you enquire.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Main Stages and Typical Durations</h2>
        <p>Sourcing can take from a few days to several weeks depending on whether the car is already identified or we are searching (e.g. at auction). Compliance and certification — including RAWS where required — typically take a few weeks once the vehicle is in Australia or at an approved facility. Shipping from Japan to an Australian port is usually in the range of a few weeks depending on route and sailings. Customs and clearance add a few days to a couple of weeks. These are typical ranges; actual timeframes depend on the specific vehicle, workshop availability and shipping schedule. We do not guarantee fixed timelines but we give you a clear expectation when we quote and will keep you updated through the process.</p>

        <h2>How We Keep It Efficient</h2>
        <p>Having team on the ground in Japan helps with sourcing and inspection, so we can move quickly from your go-ahead to purchase. We then manage compliance and shipping in sequence so there are no unnecessary delays.

            <summary>Can you give a fixed delivery date?</summary>
            <p>We give you an expected timeline based on your vehicle and destination. Exact dates depend on sourcing, compliance and shipping; we keep you updated as the job progresses.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does bulk import take longer?</summary>
            <p>Bulk orders involve multiple vehicles, so the overall process can take longer, but we run them in parallel where possible and will give you a timeline when you enquire.</p>
