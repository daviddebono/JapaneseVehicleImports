        <h1>Japanese Car Auction Buying Guide: How to Buy at Auction</h1>
        <p class="section-subtitle">What you need to know about Japanese car auctions — grades, inspections and why having a team on the ground in Japan gives you an edge.</p>
        <div class="card section-alt" style="padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
          <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; margin: 0 0 0.5rem;">Summary</h2>
          <p style="margin: 0;">Japanese car auctions are a major source of used cars for export. Auctions use grade and condition reports. Buying through a broker with team on the ground in Japan means someone can inspect vehicles and bid on your behalf, reducing the risk of buying unseen. We then manage Australian compliance and delivery to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart.</p>

        <h2>How Japanese Car Auctions Work</h2>
        <p>Japan has a large and well-organised used car auction system. Vehicles are graded for condition and mileage, and auction sheets describe damage, repairs and options. Buyers (or their agents) bid at auction; the highest bidder wins. For Australian buyers, the challenge is distance: you need someone you trust to inspect and bid on your behalf. Unlike many brokers, we have team members on the ground in Japan who do exactly that — they inspect vehicles and purchase from auction on your behalf.</p>

        <h2>Grades and Condition Reports</h2>
        <p>Auction houses assign grades (typically on a letter or number scale) to indicate overall condition. Sheets also note interior and exterior condition, mechanical issues and odometer reading. These are useful but not a substitute for a physical inspection. Our team in Japan can view the vehicle before bidding, so you have a much better idea of what you are buying. We also confirm that the vehicle can be imported to Australia and manage all <a href="/services/japanese-car-imports.html">compliance and certification</a> once purchased.</p>

        <h2>Why Use a Broker With a Team in Japan?</h2>
        <p>Buying at a Japanese auction remotely — without someone on the ground — means relying only on grades and sheets. That can work, but it increases the risk of surprises. A broker with staff in Japan can inspect the car, bid with your authority and report back. We then handle shipping, compliance and delivery to your chosen location in Australia. We service <a href="/locations/sydney.html">Sydney</a>, <a href="/locations/melbourne.html">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/locations/brisbane.html">Brisbane</a>, <a href="/locations/adelaide.html">Adelaide</a>, <a href="/locations/canberra.html">Canberra</a> and <a href="/locations/hobart.html">Hobart</a>.</p>
