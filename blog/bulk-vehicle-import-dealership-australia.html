        <h1>Bulk Vehicle Import for Dealerships: How It Works</h1>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Dealerships can give a broker a shopping list of desired cars; we confirm eligibility and quantity and manage the full import process from Japan to delivery.</p>
        <div class="card section-alt" style="padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
          <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; margin: 0 0 0.5rem;">Summary</h2>
          <p style="margin: 0;">Bulk vehicle imports let dealerships order multiple Japanese cars (or vans/trucks) through one broker. You provide a shopping list; we confirm which vehicles can be imported to Australia and in what quantity, then source (including via auction), manage compliance and certification, and deliver to your chosen port or location. We have team on the ground in Japan to inspect and purchase on your behalf.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Dealerships Use Bulk Import</h2>
        <p>Dealerships often want a consistent supply of Japanese vehicles — whether popular models, niche cars or commercial vehicles. Managing multiple single-vehicle imports is inefficient. A bulk import arrangement lets you give your broker a list of desired makes, models and (where relevant) specifications. We confirm eligibility for Australia and the quantity we can source, then run the full process: sourcing (including at Japanese auction, where our team inspects and buys on your behalf), compliance and certification, shipping and delivery. You get one point of contact and consistent documentation.</p>

        <h2>The Shopping List Process</h2>
        <p>You tell us what you want: e.g. model types, approximate numbers, budget range. We check each type for Australian compliance and advise what we can source. Unlike other brokers, we have members of our team on the ground in Japan, so we can inspect vehicles and purchase from auction at scale. We then manage all compliance and certification for each unit and coordinate delivery to your nominated location — whether that is <a href="/locations/sydney.html">Sydney</a>, <a href="/locations/melbourne.html">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/locations/brisbane.html">Brisbane</a>, <a href="/locations/adelaide.html">Adelaide</a>, <a href="/locations/canberra.html">Canberra</a> or <a href="/locations/hobart.html">Hobart</a>.</p>

        <h2>Eligibility and Quantity</h2>
        <p>Not every vehicle can be imported to Australia; eligibility depends on the model and current rules. We confirm eligibility before you commit and give you a clear picture of quantity we can realistically source. That way you can plan stock and pricing. Our <a href="/services/japanese-car-imports.html">Japanese car imports</a>, <a href="/services/japanese-van-imports.html">van</a> and <a href="/services/japanese-truck-imports.html">truck</a> services all support bulk orders with the same process.</p>
