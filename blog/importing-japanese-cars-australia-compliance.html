        <h1>Importing Japanese Cars to Australia: Compliance and Certification</h1>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Understanding Australian compliance and certification when importing a car from Japan — and why using a broker saves time and reduces risk.</p>
        <div class="card section-alt" style="padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
          <h2 style="font-size: 1rem; margin: 0 0 0.5rem;">Summary</h2>
          <p style="margin: 0;">Importing a Japanese car to Australia requires the vehicle to meet Australian design rules and, where applicable, to be processed through a RAWS-approved workshop. A broker can confirm eligibility before you buy, manage all compliance and certification, and coordinate shipping and clearance. We service Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Compliance Matters</h2>
        <p>Australia has strict rules about which vehicles can be imported and registered. Not every Japanese car is eligible. Before you commit to a purchase, you need to know that the vehicle can be imported to Australia and what compliance and certification steps are required. Getting this wrong can mean extra cost, delay or, in the worst case, a vehicle that cannot be registered here.</p>

        <h2>Australian Design Rules and Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Imported vehicles must comply with Australian Design Rules (ADRs) applicable at the time of manufacture or as determined by the federal regulator. Eligibility depends on the specific model, variant and build date. A broker who specialises in <a href="/services/japanese-car-imports.html">Japanese car imports</a> will check each vehicle for Australian compliance before you buy. That way you are not left with a car that cannot be imported.</p>

        <h3>RAWS and Certification</h3>
        <p>Where a vehicle requires modification or certification to meet Australian standards, it typically must go through a RAWS (Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme) approved workshop. The workshop issues the documentation needed for registration. As your broker, we manage this process: we ensure the vehicle can be imported and we coordinate all compliance and certification so the car lands ready for registration (subject to your state or territory requirements).</p>

        <h2>How a Broker Helps</h2>
        <p>If you are looking for a broker to assist you in importing a car from Japan, the key benefits are: (1) we confirm eligibility before you commit; (2) we manage all compliance and certification; (3) we coordinate shipping and customs clearance; (4) we deliver to your chosen location. We service customers across <a href="/locations/sydney.html">Sydney</a>, <a href="/locations/melbourne.html">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/locations/brisbane.html">Brisbane</a>, <a href="/locations/adelaide.html">Adelaide</a>, <a href="/locations/canberra.html">Canberra</a> and <a href="/locations/hobart.html">Hobart</a>. Unlike many brokers, we have team members on the ground in Japan who inspect vehicles and purchase from auction on your behalf.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Tell us what car you are interested in. We will confirm whether it can be imported to Australia and outline the compliance and certification steps, then manage the full process from Japan to delivery.</p>
