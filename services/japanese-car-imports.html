        <p>If you are looking for a broker to assist you in importing a car from Japan, Japanese Vehicle Imports will ensure that the vehicle can be imported to Australia and we will manage all the compliance and certification to get it here. We service customers across <a href="/locations/sydney.html">Sydney</a>, <a href="/locations/melbourne.html">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/locations/brisbane.html">Brisbane</a>, <a href="/locations/adelaide.html">Adelaide</a>, <a href="/locations/canberra.html">Canberra</a> and <a href="/locations/hobart.html">Hobart</a>, including major suburbs in each city. Whether you are a private buyer or a dealership with a shopping list of desired cars, we confirm eligibility and manage the full import process.</p>

        <h2>Why Use a Broker for Japanese Car Imports?</h2>
        <p>Importing a car from Japan to Australia involves eligibility checks, compliance with Australian design rules, certification (including through a RAWS-approved workshop where required), shipping and customs clearance. As your broker, we handle these steps so you can focus on choosing the right vehicle and receiving it ready for registration. We check each vehicle for Australian compliance before you commit, so you are not left with a car that cannot be imported.</p>

        <h2>Our Team on the Ground in Japan</h2>
        <p>Unlike many brokers, we have members of our team on the ground in Japan. They inspect cars and purchase them from auction on your behalf. That means you get real visibility over condition and price, and we can bid and buy with your authority. For private buyers and dealerships alike, this is a significant advantage: you are not relying on remote-only arrangements or third-party auction buyers with no direct link to your broker.</p>

        <h2>Bulk Vehicle Imports for Dealerships</h2>
        <p>We also do bulk vehicle imports. If you are a dealership, you can give us a shopping list of desired cars. We confirm their eligibility for Australia and the quantity we can source, then manage the full process from Japan to delivery. We coordinate compliance and certification for each vehicle and deliver to your chosen port or location. Unlike other brokers, our team in Japan can inspect and purchase from auction at scale, so bulk orders are handled with the same rigour as single-vehicle imports.</p>

        <h2>Where We Service</h2>
        <p>We service Sydney (including North Sydney, Parramatta, Chatswood, Liverpool, Penrith, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Alexandria and surrounding suburbs), Melbourne (including CBD, Docklands, Richmond, South Yarra, Footscray, Dandenong, Clayton, Glen Waverley and greater Melbourne), Brisbane (including CBD, Fortitude Valley, South Brisbane, Sunnybank, Logan, Gold Coast corridor and surrounding areas), Adelaide (including CBD, North Adelaide, Norwood, Glenelg, Port Adelaide, Salisbury and greater Adelaide), Canberra (including Civic, Belconnen, Woden, Tuggeranong, Gungahlin and surrounds) and Hobart (including CBD, Glenorchy, Kingston, Clarence and greater Hobart). We coordinate delivery to your chosen Australian port or location; registration is then handled according to your state or territory requirements.</p>

        <h2>What We Do From Start to Finish</h2>
        <p>From your first enquiry we confirm whether the car you want can be imported to Australia. We then source the vehicle — including via Japanese auction where our team inspects and purchases on your behalf — and manage all compliance and certification. We coordinate shipping and customs clearance and deliver to your nominated location. You receive documentation for registration. For bulk orders we apply the same process at scale with consistent communication and paperwork.</p>
