        <p>If you are looking for a broker to assist you in importing a van from Japan, Japanese Vehicle Imports will ensure that the vehicle can be imported to Australia and we will manage all the compliance and certification to get it here. We service customers across <a href="/locations/sydney.html">Sydney</a>, <a href="/locations/melbourne.html">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/locations/brisbane.html">Brisbane</a>, <a href="/locations/adelaide.html">Adelaide</a>, <a href="/locations/canberra.html">Canberra</a> and <a href="/locations/hobart.html">Hobart</a>, including major suburbs in each city. Whether you need a single van for your business or fleet or are considering multiple units, we confirm eligibility and manage the full import process.</p>

        <h2>Why Use a Broker for Japanese Van Imports?</h2>
        <p>Japanese vans — both commercial and passenger — are popular in Australia for their reliability and value. Importing one requires eligibility verification, compliance with Australian design rules, certification (including through a RAWS-approved workshop where applicable), shipping and customs. As your broker we handle these steps so your van lands ready for registration. We check each vehicle for Australian compliance before you commit, avoiding the risk of purchasing a van that cannot be imported.</p>

        <h2>Our Team on the Ground in Japan</h2>
        <p>Unlike many brokers, we have members of our team on the ground in Japan. They inspect vans and purchase them from auction on your behalf. That gives you direct control over condition and price and avoids the pitfalls of remote-only sourcing. For businesses and fleets this is especially valuable: you get real visibility before the vehicle leaves Japan.</p>

        <h2>Bulk Van Imports for Businesses</h2>
        <p>We also do bulk vehicle imports. If you are a dealership or fleet operator and need multiple vans, you can give us a shopping list. We confirm eligibility for Australia and the quantity we can source, then manage the full process. Our team in Japan can inspect and purchase from auction on your behalf at scale, so bulk orders are handled with the same attention as single-vehicle imports.</p>

        <h2>Where We Service</h2>
        <p>We service Sydney (including North Sydney, Parramatta, Chatswood, Liverpool, Penrith, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Alexandria and surrounding suburbs), Melbourne (including CBD, Docklands, Richmond, South Yarra, Footscray, Dandenong, Clayton, Glen Waverley and greater Melbourne), Brisbane (including CBD, Fortitude Valley, South Brisbane, Sunnybank, Logan, Gold Coast corridor and surrounding areas), Adelaide (including CBD, North Adelaide, Norwood, Glenelg, Port Adelaide, Salisbury and greater Adelaide), Canberra (including Civic, Belconnen, Woden, Tuggeranong, Gungahlin and surrounds) and Hobart (including CBD, Glenorchy, Kingston, Clarence and greater Hobart). We coordinate delivery to your chosen Australian port or location; registration is then handled according to your state or territory requirements.</p>

        <h2>What We Do From Start to Finish</h2>
        <p>From your first enquiry we confirm whether the van you want can be imported to Australia. We then source the vehicle — including via Japanese auction where our team inspects and purchases on your behalf — and manage all compliance and certification. We coordinate shipping and customs clearance and deliver to your nominated location. You receive documentation for registration. For bulk orders we apply the same process at scale with consistent communication and paperwork.</p>
